Hi, I am Shahroz. I am a Computer Science Professional and Mobile App developer using Flutter and Native tech with 2+ years of experience. In every project I have worked on my goal is to create scalable and reliable application. UI/UX is one of the most important things in mobile apps. That's why I am very attentive to design layout and always deliver pixel-perfect layouts tested on various devices.<br><br>
I have the opportunity to work on some great and cool projects which you can check on my portfolio and Github. I am always looking to expand my skills and grow professionally. My main focus is Mobile development with an emphasis on Flutter(Dart), React Native, Android(JAVA) with frontend and backend, however, I have also experience in Python, Django, and C++.
